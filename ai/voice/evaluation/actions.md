# Voice AI Evaluation: Actions

## Problem Statement
Business stakeholders cannot trust AI agents to deliver reliable outcomes because there is no systematic way to verify that agent actions align with business expectations. This creates uncertainty in decision-making and limits the business value that can be derived from AI investments.

## Challenges

1. **Trust Gap:** Business stakeholders cannot confidently rely on AI agents because there is no way to verify that all expected business actions were completed, leading to manual oversight and reduced operational efficiency.
1. **Risk Exposure:** Organizations cannot detect when AI agents perform unintended actions that could impact business operations, customer experience, or compliance requirements, creating potential liability and reputational risks.

## Risks of Not Solving This

- **Revenue Loss:** AI agents may fail to complete critical business actions, leading to lost sales, missed opportunities, or customer churn
- **Operational Inefficiency:** Manual oversight of AI agent actions consumes valuable business resources and creates bottlenecks in automated processes
- **Compliance and Liability Risk:** Unintended AI actions could violate regulations, breach contracts, or damage customer relationships, resulting in legal and financial consequences

## Goal

Enable business stakeholders to confidently deploy and rely on AI agents by providing systematic verification that agent actions align with business expectations. This will maximize the business value derived from AI investments while minimizing operational risks and ensuring reliable business outcomes.
