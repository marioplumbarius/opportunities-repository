# Voice AI Evaluation: Actions

## Problem Statement
As we develop AI agents, ensuring that they take the correct actions during interactions is critical. Currently, we lack a systematic way to confirm that an agentâ€™s actions align with what is expected.

## Challenges

1. **Completeness:** How do we verify that all expected actions actually occurred?  
1. **Accuracy:** How do we detect any unintended actions the agent may have performed?

## Risks of Not Solving This

- Missing critical actions or bugs in the AI agent  
- Deploying agents that produce inconsistent or unintended outputs  
- Slowing development due to manual, error-prone verification

## Goal

Create a robust, automated framework to assess both the **completeness** and **accuracy** of actions taken by AI agents, giving confidence in the reliability and quality of our systems.
