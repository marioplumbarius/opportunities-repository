# Analytics: Static Visualizations

## Problem Statement
Business stakeholders cannot make informed decisions when their specific queries cannot be properly represented in existing dashboard widgets. Static visualizations force decision-makers to manually analyze data entries, leading to delayed responses to critical business issues and missed opportunities for optimization.

## Challenges

1. **Query Representation Gap:** Business queries cannot be properly represented in existing dashboard widgets, forcing stakeholders to make decisions without the specific insights they need, leading to suboptimal business outcomes.
1. **Decision Delays:** When queries don't match available visualizations, decision-makers must manually analyze data, causing delays in responding to market changes, operational issues, or competitive threats.
1. **Engineering Dependency:** Business teams must engage the IT department to update visualizations for new queries, creating delays and resource constraints that prevent rapid response to changing business needs.
1. **Missed Business Opportunities:** Critical patterns and anomalies in domain-specific data remain undetected because they cannot be surfaced through static interfaces, resulting in lost revenue opportunities and unaddressed operational risks.

## Risks of Not Solving This

- **Revenue Loss:** Missed opportunities due to inability to quickly identify and respond to market trends or customer behavior patterns
- **Competitive Disadvantage:** Slower decision-making compared to competitors who can rapidly adapt their analytics to changing business needs
- **Engineering Resource Drain:** High-cost engineering resources are consumed by dashboard maintenance requests instead of strategic product development, while business teams wait weeks or months for visualization updates
- **Operational Inefficiency:** Critical issues (data quality problems, system failures, performance bottlenecks) remain undetected, leading to customer impact and increased operational costs

## Goal

Enable business stakeholders to make data-driven decisions by providing dashboard visualizations that can represent any business query, ensuring that critical insights are immediately accessible when needed. This will accelerate response times to market opportunities, operational issues, and competitive threats while maximizing the business value derived from existing data assets.
