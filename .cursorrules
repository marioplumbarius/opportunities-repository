# Cursor Rules for Opportunities Repository

## File Templates

### Markdown Files
When creating new markdown files, use the following template structure based on `ai/voice/evaluation/actions.md`:

```markdown
# [Title]

## Problem Statement
[Describe the problem or opportunity being addressed]

## Challenges

1. **[Challenge 1]:** [Description of the challenge]
1. **[Challenge 2]:** [Description of the challenge]

## Risks of Not Solving This

- [Risk 1]
- [Risk 2]
- [Risk 3]

## Goal

[Describe the desired outcome or solution]
```

## Project Guidelines

- Use clear, descriptive titles for all markdown files
- Follow the structured format above for consistency
- Focus on problem definition, challenges, risks, and goals
- Keep content concise and actionable

## Content Focus Requirements

### Business Value Focus
- **Always frame problems from a business value perspective, not user experience**
- Focus on business impact: revenue loss, competitive disadvantage, operational inefficiency
- Emphasize decision-making capabilities and business outcomes
- Avoid technical implementation details in problem statements

### Challenge Writing Guidelines
- Frame challenges as business limitations that prevent optimal outcomes
- Focus on what stakeholders cannot achieve rather than what systems cannot do
- Include specific business consequences (delays, missed opportunities, resource drain)
- Examples: "Query Representation Gap", "Decision Delays", "Engineering Dependency", "Missed Business Opportunities"

### Risk Writing Guidelines
- Emphasize direct business impact: revenue, competitive position, operational costs
- Include specific consequences like "Engineering Resource Drain" for technical dependencies
- Focus on what happens if the problem isn't solved, not just what the problem is
- Use business language: "Revenue Loss", "Competitive Disadvantage", "Operational Inefficiency"

### Goal Writing Guidelines
- Focus on enabling business stakeholders to achieve business outcomes
- Emphasize decision-making capabilities and business value
- Avoid technical solution descriptions (no AI, automation, or implementation details)
- Focus on what business users can accomplish, not how they accomplish it
